# Object Detection

The main goal of this project is to build an object detection model from scratch using PyTorch.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pascal VOC dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinpersson/pascal-voc-dataset-used-in-yolov3-video).

## Features

The notebook is designed for:

- Learning purposes
- Demonstrating how YOLOv3 works

## File Information

- **Filename**: `finalnoteboook.ipynb`
- **Type**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python (>= 3.7)
2. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Necessary Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(*If a **`requirements.txt`** file is not included, manually install the required libraries.*)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/objectdetection.git
   cd objectdetection
   ```

2. run the note book:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   or
   collab
   or
   kaggle 
   ```

3. Open `finalnoteboook.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Sample Results

Below are some sample results generated by the object detection model:

requirements 
train the model for Mscoco
improve the accuracy and i don't why but it less then the actual acccuracy?
**Letâ€™s learn and build together.**
THANK YOu
