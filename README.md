# Object Detection

The main goal of this project is to build an object detection model from scratch using PyTorch.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pascal VOC dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinpersson/pascal-voc-dataset-used-in-yolov3-video).

## Features

The notebook is designed for:

- Learning purposes
- Demonstrating how YOLOv3 works

## File Information

- **Filename**: `finalnoteboook.ipynb`
- **Type**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python (>= 3.7)
2. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Necessary Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install matplotlib
```

## How to Learn

- **Official Documentation**: [PyTorch Docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- **Learn from Scratch**: [Learn PyTorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
- **Video Tutorial**: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=2598s)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/objectdetection.git
   cd objectdetection
   ```

2. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Alternatively, you can run it on platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks.

3. Open `finalnoteboook.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
